All Reservations placed through the Website or App are accepted, reviewed, and ultimately fulfilled by the Partners. You acknowledge and agree that you are only Reserving your preferred Products on the App and/ or Website and you are not completing a sale and purchase transaction of the same on the App and/ or the Website. All sale and purchase transactions are solely made between you and the Partners. Each Product listed on the App and/ or Website is not an offer to sell such Product but only an opportunity based on your volition for a future purchase from BVault partners.            
        </li>
        <li>
            You acknowledge and agree that BVault does not sell, offer to sell, invite to sell, or solicit any offers but merely acts a facilitator to reserve the Products. In all instances, all sales are promoted, accepted, made and delivered by licensed retailers/outlets who receive all orders and offers. No part of the Services is intended to facilitate any improper furnishing of inducements by any manufacturer, importer, supplier, wholesaler or distributor of Products to any Partner or any improper exclusionary practices by any beverage licensee.

        Processing and Delivery of Products        
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            BVault provides a tool for our Partners to display their Products on our App and Website through which the BVault account holder may reserve a particular Product. Our App provides a platform through which all Reservations of Products are processed. All Users shall be required to create the BVault account and all payments in respect of the Products which are Reserved may be made through credit card, debit card, net banking and wallets, the monetary value of which shall be received by the respective Partner from whom the account holder redeems the Product. At the time you Reserve Products on the App, your BVault account shall be charged through a third party payment gateway, which shall, subject to the terms and conditions agreed with the payment gateway of these Terms, transfer and deliver the funds to the Partners. Please note that a Reservation of a Product does not constitute actual purchase of such Product, at any point of time. In fact, a User is free to cancel such Reservation or not redeem such Product from the Partner. Only at the time of syncing of the User's mobile device with the Partner's, i.e. at the time of Redemption / pick-up of the Product, is the transaction complete, with transfer of BVault account funds to the Partner's account.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Neither BVault, nor any officer, director, employee, shareholder or agent of BVault shall be liable to the User or any third-party for any claims relating to the reservation, delivery and/or consumption of the Product or any consequences which may result thereof.            
        </li>
        <li>
            By completing a Reservation through the App, you agree that you are of the relevant legal age as per Applicable Law in the State in which you are domiciled, to reserve and thereafter consume such Products and you shall be present to accept the delivery of Products.            
        </li>
        <li>
            In the event that there is no individual who is of the relevant legal age as per Applicable Law in the State in which he is domiciled, to Reserve and thereafter consume such Products or such individual cannot provide valid identification showing the proof of his or her age or other excise prerequisites such as "permit", the Partner may deny service and/or delivery of the Products.            
        </li>
        <li>
            The Partners reserve the right to refuse to deliver Products for any reason. This reservation includes, but is not limited to, refusing service to individuals who are visibly intoxicated in the interest and safety or by policy on admission rights.            
        </li>
